= bglogger

A logging, profiling, and testing library for C and C++.

== Features

* Integrated logging, testing, and profiling library
* C and C++ support
* Can be completely turned off to have zero runtime overhead
* Send recorded data to multiple destinations simultaneously
* Can record data to stdout, stderr, Linux syslog, and files
* Filter output data per device
* output format is either CSV, space-separated, or JSON
* profiling function counts are exact (not sampling)
* data is saved using structure, facilitating further processing
